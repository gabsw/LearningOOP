Guessing Game Rules:

The game consists of 4 hidden numbers, ranging from 0 to 9, and the player must guess all the numbers in the correct position in 10 tries. If the player fails to guess the correct digits, you should print how many numbers he guessed in the correct position and how many numbers he guessed in the wrong position (that is, the number is part of the answer, but should be at a different position).

For example, let the hidden numbers be (3; 1; 4; 9). The following happens:

The player guesses (2; 1; 9; 9). The game prints that he got 2 numbers in the correct position and 1 number that is in the answer, but at the wrong positions, even though 9 only appears once and has already been fulfilled.
The player guesses (2; 1; 9; 8). The game prints that he got 1 number in the correct position and 1 number that is in the answer, but at the wrong position.
The player guesses (2; 1; 8; 9). The game prints 2 and 0, in the same order as above.
The player guesses (3; 1; 8; 9). The game prints 3 and 0.
The player guesses (3; 1; 4; 9. The game prints the victory message.
