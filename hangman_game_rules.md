# Hangman Game Rules

One word from the English language will be chosen randomly and each of the letters that compose that word will be represented by a slash. The player will guess a letter. If that letter is in the word, the letter will be written in every place it would appear. If the letter isn't in the word, the player will lose a try. The game will start out with five tries available to the player. The player will continue guessing letters until they can either solve the word or he runs out of tries and loses.
