# Blackjack rules

These were based on the rules found on https://www.bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/, with a couple of changes.

Object of the game - Each participant attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.

Deck - This game will be played with a traditional deck of 312 cards (composed of 6 52-card decks). The deck will be shuffled before the game begins and every time there are only 60 cards left, to avoid card counting.

Cards Value - It is up to each individual player if an ace is worth 1 or 11. Face cards are 10 and any other card is its pip value.

Bets - The player will establish his money pool at the beginning of the game and will place a bet before the next round starts. If the player wins the round, he will add the betted amount to his money pile. If the player draws, there will not be any money added or subtracted to the money pool. If the player loses, the bet will be subtracted from the money pool. If the money pool reaches 0, the player will be kicked out of the table.

Player’s Play – The first card will be automatically selected for the player. After each play, the player will be asked if he wants to “stand” (use the value of the current hand as his final result) or “hit” (receive another card). If his hand is over 21, by other words, if the total value of his cards exceeds 21, he will bust automatically and lose the round.

Croupier’s Play – The first card will be automatically selected for the croupier. If the total is 17 or more, he must stand. If the total is 16 or under, he must take a card. He must continue to take cards until the total is 17 or more, at which point the dealer must stand. If his hand is over 21, by other words, if the total value of his cards exceeds 21, he will bust automatically and lose the round.

End of Round – If neither the player or croupier have busted, their final scores will be compared against each other to determine who has the highest score. The person with the highest score will win the bet.
